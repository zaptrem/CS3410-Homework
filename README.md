# CS3410-Homework

Welcome!

Gitpod is a service that provides VSCode+Linux in the browser using the magic of Docker,
perfect for development on Chrome Books, iPads, or any device where you would like to
pick up and drop development projects/assignments like you would a Netflix show.

VSCode in the browser can be used exactly the same way as the VM image, just create and
edit C files in the GUI and use the console at the bottom to compile/run.

Everything should work similarly to the VM Image. However, we're using more recent
versions of all the software and settings may not be identical, so some results may very.

Included in this repo is the first hello.c assignment to demonstrate usage.

1. Fork me!
2. Open here: [![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/zaptrem/CS3410-Homework)
3. Run this command: gcc -o sayhello hello.c

In the future, simply create new C files as needed and follow homework instructions.
Whenever you're not using Gitpod, your Linux instance is unloaded and stored for next time.
